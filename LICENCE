### **Project Overview**:

**WhatDoYouHate** is an innovative platform designed to give people a space where they can express dislikes, share their frustrations, and track global sentiment around various topics across the globe. The platform allows users to vote on things they dislike, from political figures to trends or even specific situations. Through voting, users can express negative sentiments in a constructive way, while others can view the most disliked topics globally, helping people gain a new understanding of societal sentiment. 

The platform’s key features include:
- Users vote anonymously on things they hate or dislike.
- Dislikes are recorded and tracked over time, creating a real-time map of global sentiment.
- The site aggregates user feedback to generate a clearer picture of worldwide preferences.
- Sentiment trends are displayed, providing users with data on what the world dislikes most.

### **Clarification of Idea**

**WhatDoYouHate** allows users to track, vote, and see global sentiment surrounding various topics, creating a space where hate (or strong negative feelings) is measured and aggregated. It’s an entirely anonymous voting system that focuses on dislikes and frustrations, helping others see which topics or figures generate the most emotional response. 

This can be an important tool for understanding what bothers or irritates people in society, opening the door for potential new insights into public opinion and even sparking conversations about common sentiments across countries or communities.

This should make it clear both in terms of the legal protections and the concept behind **"WhatDoYouHate."** It explains the idea behind the platform, its purpose, and how it collects and displays data about dislikes or negative sentiments.
